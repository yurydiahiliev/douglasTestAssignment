# Douglas Test Task

This is a test automation project with UI tests for ["Douglas web-site"](https://www.douglas.de/)

## Pre-requisites

For building this project it is necessary to install the following:

- Installed Java 17 ([Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html))
- Installed Git ([Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- Installed Maven 3.6+ ([Maven Downloads](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))

## Set up and running tests

```
   $ https://github.com/yurydiahiliev/douglasTestAssignment.git
   $ mvn clean install
```

For locally running tests, use "FilterProductsTests.java" class to run all tests immediately

In both cases we have automatically generated Allure report, for more details use this link
([Allure Report](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/))
Otherwise, report can be generated by separate CLI command

```
   $ mvn site
```
After executing report will be available in build directory and can be opened through index.html file in any of browsers:
```
   $ /target/site/allure-maven-plugin
```
